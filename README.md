# Bias-Variance-Analysis-of-Constant-and-Linear-Models-in-a-Noisy-Regression-Task
This assignment analyzes how constant (H₀) and linear (H₁) models learn a noisy quadratic target function using small datasets. You will simulate data, estimate bias and variance, compute expected error, and compare which model class best predicts the underlying function.
